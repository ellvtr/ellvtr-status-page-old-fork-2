## Context

I couldn't make a pull request to the original repo. So I 
detached my fork because the git history was not compatible 
with the original repo.

    Fix data structure for d3 chart
    
    Fixes #15
    There was a bug in `restructureAndPersistData` on nmservice;
    it only added the network key as a node for each network;
    now it loops through each node and adds it to
    `restructuredData`.
    Added file with correct structure `/mock/data/restructuredData2.json`

    Fix data structure for d3 chart
    
    Issue #15
    
    Fixed partly: `initGraphData` in home.component created
    empty `Link` instances with undefined properties. Chart now
    renders but has no links between nodes.
    
    Another problem is, that the `restructureData` generated by
    `restructureAndPersistData` in nmservice does not have links
    between its nodes. See the outcome in the file
    `/mock/data/restructuredData.json(.txt)` which derived from
    `/mock/data/network-info.json`.

    Simplify / refactor home component and nmservice & extra mock endpoint no longer in use
    
    See issues #6 #7
    
    nmservice `restructureAndPersistData` and `retrievePersistedDataForGraph`
    refactored to return data, not promise.
    
    Home component `updateMetrics` and `initGraphData` no longer handle
    promise.
    
    `graph.visual.service.ts` also adapted to function returning data, not
    promise.
    
    `host:3000/data` endpoint no longer needed, `/mock/serv.js` changed
    accordingly.

    Simplify / refactor home component and nmservice
    
    See issues #6 #7
    
    Simplified and removed much code; still remains to
    change 2 async promise functions in to sequential and
    find bug in `restructuredData` which doesn't work
    
    WIP thorough refactoring of
    `<homecomp>.updateMetrics`, `<nmservice>.restructureAndPersistData`
    and `<nmservice>.retrievePersistedDataForGraph`

    Reconstruct lost code after rebase error
    
    I rebased repo in order to change past commit emails. During the rebase there were
    merge conflicts; after fixing those, git asked me to add the files and I
    only added the conflicting file resulting in all other files to go missing.
    I managed to find them in another directory and some were still open in the editor.

    Simplify/improve home component
    
    See issue #8.
    Loads of redundant markup removed again and style improved.
    Just noticed that layout is not responsive. May need to re-design from
    scratch using e.g. bootstrap or foundation or similar.
